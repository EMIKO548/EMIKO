# This is a small python program to divide a numerator by a denominator.  Division means repeated substraction.
# Division will occur as along as the denominator is not 0. No numerator can be divided by 0 to give an any positive or 
# negative integer as it is epistemologically impossible. The answer is undefined in a mathematical context.
